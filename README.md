# Meaurement Evaluation (assignment 3)
## Group3

Place the measurements csv into the `measurements` directory and name it 
`measurements.csv`

To execute `reporter.py` use the following command and execute it from the 
parent directory

```python -m cmb-assignment-3.reporter -r [option]```

The code above assumes the directory of the repo is named as the repo itself. 
If it isn't please use your directory name.

Use `-h` instead of `-r [option]` to check for all possible options
